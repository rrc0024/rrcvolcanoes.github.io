    <h1 id="vdangerheading">The Dangers of Volcanoes</h1>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Volcanoes, although they are cool, are still a type of
    natural disaster. And because of that, they have many
    dangers and threats that come with their presence.</p>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Some dangers caused by volcanoes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The lava could burn someone</li>
      <li>The lava could bury things</li>
      <li>The ash and gas could suffocate/poison someone</li>
      <li>The tectonic plate movement could spark and earthquake or tsunami</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="ldangers"><h3>Lava Dangers</h3>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Lava is a dangerous substance. It can be over 2,000
    degrees fahrenheit. That heat will definitely burn you, and
    you may even die if you get stuck in the lava flow. If you swiftly
    touch the lava, you will definitely get a bad burn.</p>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Lava can also bury things. Most lava flows are slow enough that most
    people will be able to escape, but homes, farms, and other structures
    can be buried by the lava flows if they're in the way.
  </p></div>
    <div id="agproblems"><h3>Ash and Gas Problems</h3>
    <p class="vdangerpara">As you may see in some pictures of volcanic eruptions,
    volcanoes not only erupt lava, they also erupt poisonous ash and gas.
    This also causes problems.</p>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Firstly, if you inhale the ash and gases,
    it can damage your lungs and other parts of your body from inhaling
    poison. Also, since the ash and gas is so hot and smoky, it will kill
    you if you get stuck in the gas you will die. It also moves
    very fast, so if you're near you may not be able to escape,
    so try to stay away from that.
    </p>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Additionally, ash and gas clouds can move far away from the source
    (the volcano). This can cause problems with aircraft, as flying through
    these ash clouds cause problems in the airplane's parts.
    Volcano ash clouds travel very far; a volcano in Iceland
    erupted and affected the airplanes in England!</p></div>
    <div id="tpthreats"><h3>Tectonic Plate Threats</h3>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Volcanoes erupt when magma goes through a split in the
    tectonic plates of the earth into the volcano's chamber.
    But tectonic plates aren't just responsible for volcanic
    activity, they're also linked to earthquakes and tsunamis.
    </p>
    <p class="vdangerpara">Because of this similarity, volcanoes can hint
      towards other disasters and erupt because of others. Earthquakes
      and tsunamis can be more devastating than volcanoes because they
      could happen right where civilization is.
