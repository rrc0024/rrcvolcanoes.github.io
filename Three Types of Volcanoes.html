    <h1>The Three Types of Volcanoes</h1>
    <div id="threetypeparadiv"><p class="threetypevolc">There are three main types of volcanoes, based on the type
    of lava that spurts out. If you don't know the types of lava,
  we suggest you check out <a href="#">that page</a> first.</p>
  <p class="threetypevolc">The first type of volcano is called a Stratovolcano,
  or a Composite Volcano. They are tall and cone-shaped,
most like the generic volcano design. Stratovolcanoes erupt Aa lava
 because they are tall and have a steep slope, resulting in
  faster and more chunky lava flows. Also, since aa lava dries faster,
  it hardens while still on the volcano, making it tall. </p>
  <p class="threetypevolc">The second type of volcano is a Cinder Cone.
  Cinder Cone volcanoes are the simplest type of volcano, because the
lava only erupts out of one vent: the top. They are cone-shaped and asymmetrical
because of hardened lava chunks. Cinder Cone volcanoes are
also the steepest volcanoes.</p>
<p class="threetypevolc">The third type of volcano is a Shield volcano.
Shield volcanoes are lower, wider and are less steep.
They erupt Pahoehoe lava and since that type of lava
hardens slower, the lava gets more of a chance to spread
wider, and overall make the volcano wider. Additionally,
the less step incline of Shield volcanoes also make
the lava slower, and pahoehoe lava.</p></div>
