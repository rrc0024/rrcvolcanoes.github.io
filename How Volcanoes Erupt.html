    <div id="eruptionpara"><p class="eruptpara">Volcanoes are most known for their
    gigantic, beautiful, but deadly and harmful
    eruptions. Ever wanted to know the process
    of how they erupted? Here's how:</p>
    <p class="eruptpara">First, molten rock from the <strong>mantle</strong>
    of the earth that is slightly lighter
    in color than the rest called <strong>magma</strong>,
    that rises up through the opening in <strong>tectonic
    plates</strong>. The magma then piles up in the volcano's <strong>chamber</strong>, and
    volcano's <strong>chamber</strong>, and pressure
    builds as more magma enters.

  <p class="eruptpara">Once the pressure in the volcano's chamber
  builds too high, the volcano explodes and the lava,
  accompanied by poisonous gases and ash
  spew everywhere.</p></div>
