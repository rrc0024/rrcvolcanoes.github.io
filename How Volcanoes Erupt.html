    <h1 id="eruptheading">How Volcanoes Erupt</h1>

    <div id="eruptionpara"><p class="eruptpara">Volcanoes are most known for their
    gigantic, beautiful, but deadly and harmful
    eruptions. Ever wanted to know the process
    of how they erupted? Here's how:</p>
    <p class="eruptpara">First, molten rock from the mantle
    of the earth that is slightly lighter
    in color than the rest called magma,
    that rises up through the opening in tectonic
    plates. The magma then piles up in the volcano's chamber, and
    volcano's chamber, and pressure
    builds as more magma enters.

  <p class="eruptpara">Once the pressure in the volcano's chamber
  builds too high, the volcano explodes and the lava,
  accompanied by poisonous gases and ash
  spew everywhere.</p></div>
